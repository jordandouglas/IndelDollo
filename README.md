# IndelDollo 


Insertions and deletions through the stochastic dollo process


An intuitive total-evidence method for combining sequence and structural information into a phylogenetic analysis.


BEAST 2 implementation of a stochastic dollo model where one or more binary traits are assumed to appear, and then sequences evolve down the tree from the birth (the origin). The sequence can die before reaching the leaves, at which point the sequence will be treated as a gap.
