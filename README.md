# IndelDollo 


Insertions and deletions through a stochastic dollo process


An intuitive total-evidence method for combining sequence and structural information in a phylogenetic analysis.


BEAST 2 implementation of a stochastic dollo model where sequence elements are acquired with an acquisition rate, and then mutate down a tree under standard substitution models. The elements can be irreversibly deleted with a loss rate.
